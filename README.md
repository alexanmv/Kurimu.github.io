# About the Database

In an attempt to make biologists, bioinformaticians and doctors work easier our team built a database which contain genetic information on most known bacteria. It’s a fully constructed database which provides available information that is needed in order to learn everything about a species’ pangenome. This information was abstracted from several research papers published in the most prominent peer reviewed scientific journals. 

# Information Provided

This database offers a variety of significant information well organized and ready to use in various domains of research. Scientists from different fields can save time and instead of spending hours reading papers trying to locate information they need, can just browse through this database, and effectively reach their target in much less time. In this database, information that is difficult to find from scratch is recorded for every species, genus, population, phylum, group, order, class, strain, or family. To make the database  easy to use by everyone below we illustrate the kind of information provided within each column.

Pangenome: The official scientific name of the species, genus, population, phylum, group, order, class, strain, or family.

Unique ID: A unique identifier for the organism which is constructed after a certain method.

NCBI_txid: The NCBI tax id which can be used in the NCBI database to gain more information about the specific organism.

Effective: The number of genomes that were used by researchers in order to conduct their research.

Level: The biological level that this organism belongs to.

Pan: The pangenome of the organism .

Core: The number of genomes located to every one of the organisms that belong to a group.

Peripheral: The number of genomes shared by some of the organisms of the group.

Unique: The number of unique genomes that exist only in some of the organisms of the group and are not sharable.

Reference: The name of the leader of the research and the year the paper was published.

DOI: The DOI from the research paper that the information was extracted from.
