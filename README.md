# About the Database
In an attempt to make biological scientists, bioinformaticians and doctors work easier our team built a database which contain information about most of the known bacteria and other species. It's a fully constructed database which provides every information that is needed in order to learn everything about a species's pangenome. These information were abstracted from various scientific researches which were contucted from sertificated and decorated scientists and which were also approved from the most respected publishers of the scientific world.
# Information Provided
This database offers a variety of significant information so well organised and ready to use in various researches. Scientists from different fields can save their time and insent of reading numerous hours papers trying to locate what they are looking for, can just browse through this database and will have anything they need in no time with much detail. In this database is recorded for every species, genus, population, phylum, group, order, class, strain or family information that is difficult to find from scratch. To make anyone whose reading this ready to dive in and search what he is looking for we explain every column what information is providing. 

Pangenome: Is the official scientific name of the species, genus, population, phylum, group, order, class, strain or family.

Unique ID: Is a unique identifier for the organism which is construted after a certain method.

NCBI_txid: Is the NCBI tax id which can be used in the NCBI database to gain more information about the specific organism.

Effective: The number of genomes that were used from scientists in order to conduct their research.

Level: The biological level that this organism belongs to.

Pan: The pangenome of the organism .

Core: The number of genomes located to every one of the organisms that belong to a group.

Peripheral: The number of genomes that share some of the organisms of the group.

Unique: The number of unique genomes that exist only in some of the organisms of the group and are not sharable.

Reference: The name of the leader of the research and the year the paper was published.

DOI: The DOI from the paper that the information were extracted from.
